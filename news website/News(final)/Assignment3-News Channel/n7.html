      <p class="para" style="font-size: 19px; color: grey;">Today, most countries are placing unprecedented pressure
        on water resources. The global population is growing fast, and estimates show that with current practices,
        the world will face a 40% shortfall between forecast demand and available supply of water by 2030.
        Furthermore, chronic water scarcity, hydrological uncertainty, and extreme weather events (floods and
        droughts) are perceived as some of the biggest threats to global prosperity and stability. Acknowledgment of
        the role that water scarcity and drought are playing in aggravating fragility and conflict is increasing.

        Feeding 9 billion people by 2050 will require a 60% increase in agricultural production, (which consumes 70%
        of the resource today), and a 15% increase in water withdrawals. Besides this increasing demand, the
        resource is already scarce in many parts of the world. Estimates indicate that 40% of the world population
        live in water scarce areas, and approximately ¼ of world’s GDP is exposed to this challenge. By 2025, about
        1.8 billion people will be living in regions or countries with absolute water scarcity. Water security is a
        major – and often growing –challenge for many countries today.

        Climate change will worsen the situation by altering hydrological cycles, making water more unpredictable
        and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. The roughly 1 billion people living in
        monsoonal basins and the 500 million people living in deltas are especially vulnerable. Flood damages are
        estimated in $120 billion per year (only from property damage), and droughts pose, among others, constraints
        to the rural poor, highly dependent on rainfall variability for subsistence.

        The fragmentation of this resource also constrains water security. There are 276 transboundary basins,
        shared by 148 countries, which account for 60% of the global freshwater flow. Similarly, 300 aquifers
        systems are transboundary in nature, meaning 2 billion people worldwide are dependent on groundwater. The
        challenges of fragmentation are often replicated at the national scale, meaning cooperation is needed to
        achieve optimal water resources management and development solutions for all riparians. To deal with these
        complex and interlinked water challenges, countries will need to improve the way they manage their water
        resources and associated services.

        To strengthen water security against this backdrop of increasing demand, water scarcity, growing
        uncertainty, greater extremes, and fragmentation challenges, clients will need to invest in institutional
        strengthening, information management, and (natural and man-made) infrastructure development. Institutional
        tools such as legal and regulatory frameworks, water pricing, and incentives are needed to better allocate,
        regulate, and conserve water resources. Information systems are needed for resource monitoring, decision
        making under uncertainty, systems analyses, and hydro-meteorological forecast and warning. Investments in
        innovative technologies for enhancing productivity, conserving and protecting resources, recycling storm
        water and wastewater, and developing non-conventional water sources should be explored in addition to
        seeking opportunities for enhanced water storage, including aquifer recharge and recovery. Ensuring the
        rapid dissemination and appropriate adaptation or application of these advances will be a key to
        strengthening global water security.
