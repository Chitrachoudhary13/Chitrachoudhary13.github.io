      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the 100% Electrification of the Konkan Railway route via video conference
        Monday at Bengaluru, Karnataka under the ‘Mission 100% Electrification - Moving towards net Zero Carbon
        Emission’ and flagged off Electric loco trains from Ratnagiri, Madgaon and Udupi. The total cost of the
        electrification of a total 740 km route of Konkan railway is Rs 1287 crore.

      Railway Electrification of Konkan Railway has been completed in 5 phases i.e Thokur-Bijoor, Bijoor-Karwar,
      Karwar-Thivim, Thivim-Ratnagiri and Ratnagiri-Roha, the last section being Ratnagiri - Thivim which was
      commissioned on March 28th 2022. All loco pilots have been trained in a phased manner for running electric
      traction loco.

      Now, Konkan Railway is 100% electrified. This will lead to higher operational efficiency and lower unit cost of
      transportation, thus benefiting the country as well as the Corporation.

      It is worthwhile to note the numerous inherent benefits of electric traction i.e. Significant savings in fuel
      expenditure i.e more than Rs 150 Cr. per annum, Seamless operation on Electric Traction, pollution-free mode of
      transportation and Reduced dependence on HSD oil. Pollution-free travel for the passengers especially when the
      train passes through the tunnels. Electrification of the KRCL route will also improve the average speed and
      throughput of the section and will help in line capacity augmentation/utilization.
