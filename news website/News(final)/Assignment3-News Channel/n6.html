    The ICC on Tuesday announced the new schedule of the Women’s World Cup 2022, with the prestigious tournament now scheduled to take place from March 4 to April 3 in New Zealand.

    The Women’s World Cup was earlier slated to take place from February 6 to March 7, 2021, but was postponed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Although the new Women’s World Cup 2022 schedule is not a carbon copy of the previous schedule, the essence of the tournament remains the same. The tournament will still be held across six different cities in New Zealand, with both the North and South islands getting games. A total of 31 matches will be played during the entirety of the tournament.

    The Women’s World Cup curtain-raiser will see New Zealand take on a yet to be determined team at the Tauranga’s Bay Oval on March 4, 2022. The summit clash of the tournament is scheduled for April 3, with Christchurch set to host the Women’s World Cup 2022 Final under lights.
    
    The Women’s World Cup 2022 will be the first global women’s cricket event to be played since the Women’s T20 World Cup held in Australia at the start of the year. The 2022 edition will see England enter the tournament as defending champions, with matches being played across the six cities of Auckland, Tauranga, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin.

    Unlike the T20 event, the Women’s World Cup 2020 will not have any pools or groups. Each of the eight competing sides will play each other once, with the top four teams progressing to the finals. Five teams, namely, New Zealand, Australia, England, South Africa and India have already qualified for the Women’s World Cup 2022, while the remaining three participants will be decided via qualifiers.</div></center></p>
