                                <p>As the protests and backlash against the newly-introduced Agnipath scheme continue
                                        throughout the nation, National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval has said that
                                        there are no questions raised regarding the rollback of the new military
                                        recruitment scheme.

                                        Despite the violent protests that sparked controversy across the nation, NSA
                                        Ajit Doval said that there is no question about the rollback of the Agnipath
                                        scheme, and violence will not be tolerated in the country. He further said that
                                        this scheme has been thought over for multiple years, and is not a prompt
                                        decision.</p>
                                While speaking to news agency ANI, Doval said, “There’s no question of a rollback. This
                                (Agnipath scheme) is not a kneejerk reaction that has come overnight. This has been
                                discussed and debated for decades… While everybody realised it was necessary, no one had
                                the will or the ability to take the risk.”

                                “The whole war is undergoing a great change. We are going toward contactless wars and
                                also going towards the war against the invisible enemy. Technology is taking over at a
                                rapid pace. If we have to prepare for tomorrow, then we have to change,” the National
                                Security Advisor said during an ANI interview.

                                Agnipath Scheme[1] (also spelled Agneepath Scheme) (Hindi: Agnīpath Yojanā, transl:
                                Fire-Path Scheme) is a new scheme introduced by the Government of India on 14 June 2022,
                                for recruitment of soldiers below the rank of commissioned officers into the three
                                services of the armed forces.[2] The Agnipath Scheme will be the only route for
                                recruitment into the military. All recruits will be hired only for a four year period.
                                Personnel recruited under this system are to be called Agniveers (transl:
                                Fire-Warriors), which will be a new military rank.[3] The introduction of the scheme has
                                been criticised for lack of consultation and public debate.[3] The scheme is scheduled
                                to be implemented from September 2022.

                                This scheme will bypass many things including long tenures, pension and other benefits
                                which were there in old system.[4] Opposition parties in India have criticised and
                                expressed concerns about the consequences of the new scheme. They have asked the scheme
                                to be put on hold and that the scheme be discussed in the Parliament.[5]

                                On 16 June 2022, violent protests erupted in several states in India where the army
                                aspirants angry with the new scheme called for its rollback and damaged public property.
                                By 17 June, 12 trains were set on fire, and the movement of 300 trains were affected.
                                214 trains were cancelled, 11 trains were diverted and 90 were terminated short of their
                                destination. <br><br><br>
