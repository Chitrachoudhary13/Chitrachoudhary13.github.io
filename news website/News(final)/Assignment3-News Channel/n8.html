        <p class="para" style="font-size: 19px; color: grey;">The Russo-Ukrainian War[18][d] is an ongoing war between
          Russia (together with pro-Russian separatist forces) and Ukraine.[e] It began in February 2014 following the
          Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity, and initially focused on the status of Crimea and the Donbas,
          internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The first eight years of the conflict included the Russian
          annexation of Crimea (2014) and the war in Donbas (2014–present) between Ukraine and Russian-backed
          separatists, as well as naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and political tensions. Following a Russian military
          build-up on the Russia–Ukraine border from late 2021, the conflict expanded significantly when Russia
          launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.

          Following the Euromaidan protests and a revolution resulting in the removal of pro-Russian President Viktor
          Yanukovych in February 2014, pro-Russian unrest erupted in parts of Ukraine. Russian soldiers without
          insignia took control of strategic positions and infrastructure in the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and
          seized the Crimean Parliament. Russia organized a controversial referendum, whose outcome was for Crimea to
          join Russia. This led to the annexation of Crimea. In April 2014, demonstrations by pro-Russian groups in
          the Donbas escalated into a war between the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists of the
          self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk republics.

          In August 2014, unmarked Russian military vehicles crossed the border[19] into the Donetsk republic. An
          undeclared war began between Ukrainian forces on one side, and separatists intermingled with Russian troops
          on the other, although Russia attempted to hide its involvement. The war settled into a static conflict,
          with repeated failed attempts at a ceasefire. In 2015, the Minsk II agreements were signed by Russia and
          Ukraine, but a number of disputes prevented them being fully implemented. By 2019, 7% of Ukraine was
          classified by the Ukrainian government as temporarily occupied territories.

          In 2021 and early 2022, there was a major Russian military build-up around Ukraine's borders. NATO accused
          Russia of planning an invasion, which it denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized the enlargement
          of NATO as a threat to his country and demanded Ukraine be barred from ever joining the military alliance.
          He also expressed irredentist views, questioned Ukraine's right to exist, and wrongfully stated that Ukraine
          was established by Vladimir Lenin.[20] On 21 February 2022, Russia officially recognised the two
          self-proclaimed separatist states in the Donbas, and openly sent troops into the territories. Three days
          later, Russia invaded Ukraine. Much of the international community has condemned Russia for its actions in
          Ukraine, accusing it of breaking international law and violating Ukrainian sovereignty. Many countries
          implemented economic sanctions against Russia, Russian individuals, or companies,[21] especially after the
          2022 invasion.
